# DeepLearningCV 

DeepLearningCV is a project exploring different ways to use deep learning for image classification.

## Background

Exploring different approaches for solving a computer vision with deep learning, and solving issues that occur when implementing the resulting model on resource constrained edge devices.

## Dataset

[Tomato Leaf Health Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishmotwani/tomato)

## Method

My intent for the notebook is to see what kind of accuracy can be achieved by a small model, then see what improvement can be found using a pretrained transfer learning approach, and finally training the small model with a different approach called knowledge distillation using the transfer learning model to train the small model along with the dataset.

## Notes

The project structure is missing a few things from the `.gitignore` file. To reproduce locally you will need to add the Kaggle dataset to the project so that it looks like this.

```
. deep-learning-cv
. - data
. . - train
. . - valid
. - notebooks
```

Once you have the data folder in the project things should work fine. I used the models folder as a storage location for models that I wanted to keep a copy of, as the ones generated by the notebook are put in the notebooks folder for now.
